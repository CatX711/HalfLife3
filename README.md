# HalfLife3

<br />
<br />

After beating the original Half-Life in celebration of the 25th anniversary, I decided to make a fanmade sequel to the Half-Life series.

## How to run?

Download the Valve intro music (aka Hazardous Environments) and replace the file path of `soundFile` with the path to your file. <br />
Download Vague Voices and replace the file path of `soundFile2` with the path to your file. <br />
Download this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQRNx3xqHwQ and replace `guitar` with the path to your file. <br /> <br />

I reccomend https://youtubemp3free.com/en/ to download all of these.
